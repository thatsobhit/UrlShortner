You can create a `Python` program which can be used to shorten a big link and also to extract original link from a shortened link. For shortening the link, we'll use a shortening web service named `tinyurl`. You need to give your link in the terminal and you'll get the shortened link/ original link in the print-screen.
 ```
What the program does? 

1. Shortening Links
- You have to give your big link in the terminal
- Program will use tinyurl server for shortening the link without using any browser
- Shortened link will pass by print() function

2. Extracting Original Links
- You have to give a shortened link in the terminal
- Program will extract the original URL from the shortened link
- Original link will pass by print() function
```
